# Python Notes and Exercises 📚🐍

Welcome to my repository of personal Python notes and exercises. This repo contains summaries, scripts, and projects developed during my learning journey.
The main idea is to share a complete roadmap for my favorite language, Python. I'll start from the very basics, learning how to manipulate all kinds of variables, up to what I consider an intermediate level. From this repository, I'll select 10 projects guided by the renowned expert Ardit Sulce, along with another 5 I'm working on.

## 📂 Structure
- `/notes/`: Written notes in Markdown.
- `/exercises/`: Python scripts for practice.
- `/projects/`: Mini projects and challenges.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Visual Studio Code

## 🚀 Purpose
Document my learning and share resources useful for others starting in Python and data science.
